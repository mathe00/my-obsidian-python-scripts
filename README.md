# My Obsidian Python Scripts

Welcome to my collection of **Obsidian Python scripts**! These scripts are designed to work with the [Obsidian Python Bridge plugin](https://github.com/mathe00/obsidian-plugin-python-bridge), which allows you to run Python scripts directly inside Obsidian. 

Here you'll find examples of scripts that automate various tasks, interact with note metadata, and streamline your workflows. The scripts are meant to inspire others on how to use Python for Obsidian, but feel free to adapt them to suit your needs!

## Usage

To use these scripts, make sure you have the **Obsidian Python Bridge** installed and configured. You can find instructions on how to install and set up the plugin [here](https://github.com/mathe00/obsidian-plugin-python-bridge).

## Scripts Overview

Each script in this repo addresses different functionalities. Whether it's automating link creation, metadata extraction, or note manipulation, the goal is to simplify and enhance your **Obsidian** experience with minimal Python code.

## Contributions

Feel free to suggest improvements or contribute new ideas!  
If you have any feedback or suggestions, you're welcome to open issues or create pull requests.
